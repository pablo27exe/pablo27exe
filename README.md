# Hi dad, hi mom, hi wolrd 🌎

#### Well, my name is Pablo, I'm a student at DASC University, majoring in software engineering. I started programming at the age of fifteen when I was in high school, using programming languages such as C++, C#, JavaScript, Swift, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. This allowed me to achieve third place in the 2022 Informatics Olympiad at the state level, and the development of the SIEP Project (Preparatory Evaluation Entry System), earning second place at the science fair. Another project I worked on was designing a game for mobile devices for both Android and iOS. During the current year, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with people applying these skills at one of the country's most important financial institutions, which has sparked my interest in focusing on CRM (Client Relationship Management), database design and management, and complementary telecommunications."

#### 🪵 I work in the wood industry, where I have been able to learn about how to carry out efficient production. Currently, a project is underway to implement software tools to automate some processes.

#### I really enjoy my career, however, I prefer to spend only the necessary time in front of a computer. In that case, I spend my time at the gym 🏋, with my friends, with my family, , riding bike 🚵, listening to rock and heavy metal🎸, or reading 📖.
